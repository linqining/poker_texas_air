/// SettlementPayoutAnonymizer — Part A Phase 1 private payout claim
/// (SETTLEMENT_PRIVACY_PLAN.md §4 Phase 1 + Part C3).
///
/// The dual settlement contract funds this helper with each hand's winners'
/// pot (`vault.settlement_fund_escrow`) and pins one claim commitment per
/// seat: `cm = poseidon(pk_lo, pk_hi, hand_binding, amount_lo, amount_hi)`
/// where `pk` is the winner's registered secp256k1 payout key (vault
/// registry). The winner then claims INSIDE a STRK20 private transaction:
/// the pool calls `privacy_claim`, which
///
///   1. re-derives `cm` from the player's registered payout key,
///   2. verifies a secp256k1 signature by that key over
///      `poseidon(cm, note_id)` — only the payout-key owner can direct the
///      payout into a specific open note,
///   3. consumes the claim (single-use) in the settlement contract,
///   4. approves the pool to pull `amount` and returns one
///      `OpenNoteDeposit` — the payout lands in a note whose owner the
///      chain cannot see.
///
/// STRK20 integration rules honored: approve (never transfer) the pool,
/// single-use claims, u128 note amounts, empty span never returned with
/// funds parked (claims always pay out exactly `amount`).
///
/// Security model: stateful helper (holds the escrow across transactions) —
/// the pool address and the settlement (dual) contract are pinned in the
/// constructor and asserted on every entry. `consume_claim` in the dual
/// contract is additionally gated to this helper, making double claims
/// impossible even across helper redeploys.
